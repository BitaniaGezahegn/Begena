Hi

I'm Trying to create a Begena playing webapp and i found the sounds that are shown in the Image ... I am trying to make an MVP so what should my enxt steps be?

OK I've implemented the changes and, I have some thoughts. 
1. The Begena has either 5 or 10 strings ... there are only 2 variations as far as i know ... so keep that in mind and we will impliment that on another version of this app. but for now we only have the option to play the 5 string version.
2. On the provided screen shot of an app called begena(made by other poople to simulate begena playing) It has different keys for each scale and major(not exact terms btw but, I call the ones called "Selamta", "Wane" etc scales and, I call the "A1 Major", "C2 Minor" etc the Majors) For example Selamta[A#1 Major] has the keys [D#2, A#1, C2, G2, F2] while Selamta[C2 Major] has the keys [F2, C2, D2, A2, G2] so their should be a way to pick the Scale(e.g. Selamta, Bati Minor etc...) and also the Major(C2 Major, A1 Minor etc...)
3. I can provide all the neccassary details to make this app accurate and functionable.
